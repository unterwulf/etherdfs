EtherDFS changelog history

v0.7 [2017-02-11]:
 - MS-DOS compat: flagging newly mapped drive so MS-DOS doesn't ignore it,
 - fixed FindNext behavior so it's compatible with ATTRIB from MS-DOS,
 - implemented the "Special Open" call (used by COPY in MSDOS 5.0 and 6.x),
 - increased timeout retries from 3 to 5 (more reliable on lossy networks),
 - fixed parsing of the MAC address provided on command-line,
 - minor speed optimizations.

v0.6 [2017-02-05]:
 - significantly reduced EtherDFS resident footprint (16K -> 7K),
 - fixed GETATTR (was returning garbage),
 - added support for 'CLOSE FILE', 'RENAME FILE' and 'SET ATTRIBS' actions.

v0.5 [2017-01-31]:
 - first public release.
